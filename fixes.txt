https://askubuntu.com/questions/1404771/screen-flicker-after-fresh-install-of-ubuntu-22-04

I did the following changes and am now flicker-free for two days:

In file /etc/default/grub I added to parameter GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT:
i915.enable_dc=0
intel_idle.max_cstate=2

then:
sudo update-grub
reboot

I will report in a week if this indeed fixes the flickering or if it just happens less often.
I never had night-light enabled.

journalctl -b0 > journal.txt

set grub boot line to
intel_idle.max_cstate=4
